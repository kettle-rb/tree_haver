# NOTE: tree-sitter-toml parser must be installed separately via your package manager
#       e.g., `apt install libtree-sitter-toml-dev` or built from source
#
# TreeHaver provides a unified interface to tree-sitter
# that works across MRI, JRuby, and TruffleRuby. It uses ruby_tree_sitter, tree_stump,
# or FFI on MRI and FFI, or jruby_tree_sitter on other platforms.
#
# These platform-specific gems are the backends that TreeHaver uses:

# FFI Backend - works on MRI, JRuby, and TruffleRuby
gem "ffi", require: false # DO NOT LOAD, because conflicts with MRI
gem "toml-rb"
gem "citrus"
gem "prism", "~> 1.6"
gem "unparser", "~> 0.8", ">= 0.8.1"

platform :mri do
  # MRI Backend
  gem "ruby_tree_sitter", require: false # DO NOT LOAD, because conflicts with FFI
  gem "markly"
  gem "commonmarker"
  # Rust Backend
  gem "tree_stump",
    # path: "../../vendor/tree_stump"
    github: "joker1007/tree_stump",
