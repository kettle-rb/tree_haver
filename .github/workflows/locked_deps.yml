# Lock/Unlock Deps Pattern
#
# Two often conflicting goals resolved!
#
#  - unlocked_deps.yml
#    - All runtime & dev dependencies, but does not have a `gemfiles/*.gemfile.lock` committed
#    - Uses an Appraisal2 "unlocked_deps" gemfile, and the current MRI Ruby release
#    - Know when new dependency releases will break local dev with unlocked dependencies
#    - Broken workflow indicates that new releases of dependencies may not work
#
#  - locked_deps.yml
#    - All runtime & dev dependencies, and has a `Gemfile.lock` committed
#    - Uses the project's main Gemfile, and the current MRI Ruby release
#    - Matches what contributors and maintainers use locally for development
#    - Broken workflow indicates that a new contributor will have a bad time
